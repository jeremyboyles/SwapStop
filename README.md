# SwapStop Frontend (React)


## Prerequisites

Before running the UI, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

Check installation with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
To Run UI Element:
```bash
git clone <frontend-repo-url> frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Running UI Tests

To run simple UI test, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
This test starts the app in a test browser, looks at the header area and verifies it has the siteâ€™s brand name. Then, checks that the navigation bar has the three key buttons. The test fails if any of these elements are missing or mislabeled.
